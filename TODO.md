# To do

Here's what I'm currently working on:

### Features

- use duration rather than numTests?
- print progress while testing
- docs: contributing.md

  + https://github.com/Gabriella439/grace/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md ?
- docs: document syntax?

- Nice errors
  + Introduce FancyError datatype and display it in LibMain?
  + https://elm-lang.org/news/compiler-errors-for-humans
  + https://hackage.haskell.org/package/diagnose-2.5.1/docs/Error-Diagnose.html
  + https://medium.com/designing-atlassian/10-design-principles-for-delightful-clis-522f363bac87
  + https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea
  + https://gleam.run/

- Packaging
  + smoke test: curl spexup && spex --version | grep "^v..."
  + move petstore to separate repo?
  + caching
    * https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/1673 
  + install script?
    * add windows and macos
    * confirm with user
    * update spexup itself? 
    * cache releases.json?
    * check what versions are locally installed already

      spexup [update] [spexup|spex] -- install latest version
    * spexup list -- lists available releases
      spexup install (spexup|spex) <version>

  + changelog generator (semantic commit messages)
  + commit hook for conventional commits?

### Bugs

- abstract types don't need to pass scope checking, but they fail during generation:

    ```
    component PetStore where
    
    addPet : POST /pet @Pet
    getPet : GET /pet/{petId : Int} -> Pet
    ```

    spex: genUserDefined: impossible, scope checker
    CallStack (from HasCallStack):
      error, called at src/Spex/Verifier/Generator.hs:198:20 in spex-0.0.0-inplace:Spex.Verifier.Generator

  They should be generated by reuse only...

- abstract types get generated, if there are not previous values to draw from.
  Fix by allowing generation to throw?
- unique types don't get checked
- normal types should sometimes generate/sometimes reuse

### Refactor

- remove ExceptT?
- remove use of String
- structured logs, returns json object with one error or one test result?
- use formatter?
